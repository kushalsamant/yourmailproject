**A Story To Tell**.

From the ink, the colours, to paints, we are the people who fall madly in love with an orchestra of colours in space. We find magic in every stroke, our hearts beat faster as they evoke, a rising tide of emotions. That there is nothing more peaceful than drawing that picture, that doodle, that painting, that caricature, and more.
 
We are a habit, a meditative process, a peace in testing times. We are the essence of calming our minds and channeling our energies into expressive forms, of brush on canvas, and pen on paper, or anything that you can think of, in your own world. We are a chance at losing ourselves in creative thought, while creating actual art.

We are a practice with the intentions of creating an opportunity for folks who can create. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent. You can talk about us to your family and friends, and ask them to make a purchase on our Instagram.

**Let's Talk Numbers**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

- A. The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

- B. Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

- C. Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

- D. We levy an extra $2 charge to the customers on every handmade illustrated postcard to help us sustain a bunch of things like our basic cost, coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, this website, PLUS any particulars we deem necessary.

- E. Since you have to use your own materials, the cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of your labour, your profit margins, are values that are unknown to us. We request you to share these values with us, PLUS any particulars you deem necessary, via email  
[_yourmailproject (at) gmail (dot) com_](mailto:yourmailproject@gmail.com).

If in simpler terms,

~~~
The selling price = S.  
Our costs = D.  
Your profit = E.
~~~

Then in simpler equations,

~~~
S = D + E.  
D = S - E.  
E = S - D.
~~~

We hope you have understood our initiative. We hope you will love to be a part of our community.
