**A Story To Tell**.

From the ink, the colours, to paints, we are the people who fall madly in love with an orchestra of colours in space. We find magic in every stroke, our hearts beat faster as they evoke, a rising tide of emotions. That there is nothing more peaceful than drawing that picture, that doodle, that painting, that caricature, and more.  
We are a habit, a meditative process, a peace in testing times. We are the essence of calming our minds and channeling our energies into expressive forms, of brush on canvas, and pen on paper, or anything that you can think of, in your own world. We are a chance at losing ourselves in creative thought, while creating actual art.  
We are a practice with the intentions of creating an opportunity for folks who can create. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent. You can talk about us to your family and friends, and ask them to make a purchase on our Instagram.
