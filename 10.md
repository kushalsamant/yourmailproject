**Let's talk numbers**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

A. The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

B. Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

C. Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

D. We levy an extra $2 charge to the customers on every handmade illustrated postcard to help us sustain a bunch of things like our basic cost, coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, this website, PLUS any particulars we deem necessary.

E. You have to use your own materials. The cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of your labour, your profit margins, PLUS any particulars you deem necessary, are values that are unknown to us.

We request you to share these values with us, via email  
[_yourmailproject (at) gmail (dot) com_](mailto:yourmailproject@gmail.com).

~~~
The selling price = S.  
Our costs = D.  
Your profit = E.
~~~

Then in simpler equations,

~~~
S = D + E.  
D = S - E.  
E = S - D.
~~~

We hope you will love to be a part of our community.
