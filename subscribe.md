**Subscribe**.

We offer subscriptions via Patreon to create an ecosystem for this community, monthly demand for handmade illustrated postcards, and monthly revenue for the illustrators.

Since every handmade illustrated postcard is unique, we do not have a fixed price for each i.e. our pricing varies. If you are subscribing, you should know that you will get one or more handmade illustrated postcards every month depending on the feel, look, touch, and quality of the illustrations.

If you want to subscribe, you can check the current subscription price <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yourmailproject?fan_landing=true" target="_blank">here</a>.
