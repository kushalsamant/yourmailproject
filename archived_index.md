This is the official website of Your Mail Project, those Handmade Illustrated Postcards from India.

Your Mail Project keeps things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

**Step 1**. If you fill <a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> form, we will use your postal address alongwith your name, phone number, and pincode to send you 11 blank postcards to illustrate upon.

**Note**: Please bear in mind that only your name will be mentioned publicly at the bottom of this page.

**Step 2**. After you receive these 11 postcards, illustrate 10 postcards anyhow you fancy and use 1 postcard to test your art materials.

**Step 3**. Share work-in-progress images to your Instagram stories and tag our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram account @yourmailproject</a>, or make an Instagram post and use hashtag #yourmailproject.

**Step 4**. Mail your illustrated postcards to us as soon as possible via speed post along with your preferred selling price for each.

**Step 5**. Albeit the original author reserves all copyrights, after we receive an illustrator's submission we use Your Mail Project brand assets to curate the project thenceforth.

**Step 6**. Every customer gets an exclusive product that will never be replicated in analog format and can be sent to friends and family via India Post with/without an accompanying message.

**Step 7**. Once a sale happens, we pay the illustrator. Read about how we handle payments <a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/yourmailproject/payments.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Step 8**. Every handmade illustrated postcard is available for sale without the guarantee that it will sell, so all payouts to illustrators are only valid for sold goods, and only unsold goods can be returned to the original author on demand.

**Step 9**. You can buy handmade illustrated postcards on <a href="https://www.mydukaan.io/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dukaan</a>.

**Step 10**. We handle complaints, inventory, operations, packaging, return orders, shipping, suggestions, and more. If there’s something you don’t see here that you’d like to know, then you can get in touch <a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/getintouch.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
