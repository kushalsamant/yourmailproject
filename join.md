**Join as an illustrator**.

If you want to illustrate: you can sign up using **<a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">this</a>** form. It asks you to enter your postal address. We use this information to ship to you a package of 11 blank postcards. Don't you forget to give your phone number too, the postman may feel the need to use it. Read on to figure what to do next.

**Your role as an artist**.

Once you receive this package, you can go all in! Unleash your creativity.

- Ideally by testing 1 postcard with your materials to see.
- We would love to see you art up 10 postcards in a month, in your own unique way, whatever you may think that means.
- And yes! Do with anything you want, feel free to doodle, draw, sketch, or paint, or whatever you think of, as art.

**Creating a symbiotic relationship**.

Remember, we handle, respect, think of, and treat your work so that ‘All copyrights are reserved by the original author of the artwork’ is something we can all agree upon.

If you want to share work in progress images with the collective then use this hashtag '#yourmailproject'. We will repost, tag, and share your stories and post with our Instagram followers.

**Dead-line**.

We have one deadline only.

- We have this because otherwise everyone procrastinates, including us.
- You need to complete the postcards in a month from the day you receive it.
- It would be better if you can complete your submission as soon as possible.

**You create, we distribute**.

Once you finish your artwork, send it to us. When your part ends, is when our has begun!

- We will collect your artwork, and photograph it.
- We will showcase it on Instagram, also tag you for exposure and publicity.
- We handle everyone's complaints, inventory, packaging, return orders, and shipping.
- So that you can meditate away and lose yourself in spellbound creativity.

**Here's some fine print in bold text**.

Please note that we do not guarantee that your artwork will sell, but we do our best to give it exposure instead. You control if it’s still available for sale, remember ‘All copyrights are reserved by the original author of the artwork’! But there’s a catch here, albeit not a serious one yet, we can only return your artwork to you if it’s not sold.

**Let's talk numbers**.

Once your artwork sells, we will pay you as an artist. We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model. We hope that this will help you calculate your selling price.

**The basic cost**.

The package of 11 postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

Returning 10 postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

Making 10 or 11 postcards shop ready should approximately cost,  
Rs. 52 +  
Rs. 46.5  
= Rs. 98.5.

Making 1 postcards shop ready should approximately cost,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

**The selling price**.

Be mindful, that you have to use your own materials. This costing excludes the cost of materials used for creating the artwork, the cost of an artist's labour, and an artist's profit margin since these values remain unknown to us.

We charge a basic minimum of $2 per postcard to sustain a bunch of things like coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, the website, &c.

It is recommended that your selling price include your basic cost, cost of materials used, cost of labour, profit margin, our $2, and any other particulars you deem necessary.

Hence, we request you to give us a selling price for your artwork/s, via email
