We use this information to ship to you a package of 11 blank postcards. Don't you forget to give your phone number too, the postman may feel the need to use it. Read on to figure what to do next.

**Your role**.

Once you receive this package, you can go all in! Unleash your creativity.

- Ideally by testing 1 postcard with your materials to see.
- We would love to see you illustrate 10 postcards in a month, in your own unique way, whatever you may think that means.
- And yes! Do with anything you want, feel free to doodle, draw, sketch, or paint, or whatever you think of, as art.

**Creating a symbiotic relationship**.

Remember, we handle, respect, think of, and treat your work so that ‘All copyrights are reserved by the original author’ is something we can all agree upon.

**Here's some fine print in bold text**.

Please note that we do not guarantee that your handmade illustrated postcards will sell, but we do our best to give it exposure instead. You control if it’s still available for sale, remember ‘All copyrights are reserved by the original author’! But there’s a catch here, albeit not a serious one yet, we can only return your handmade illustrated postcards to you if it’s not sold.

**Let's talk numbers**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

We levy an extra $2 charge to the customers on every handmade illustrated postcard to help us sustain a bunch of things like our basic cost, coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, this website, &c.

Be mindful that, since you have to use your own materials, we request you to share a bunch of things like the cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of your labour, your profit margins, PLUS any particulars you deem necessary, via email  
[_yourmailproject (at) gmail (dot) com_](mailto:yourmailproject@gmail.com).

This will help us to figure selling price of a handmade illustrated postcard. We will pay you, only after your handmade illustrated postcard sells. We hope you will love to be a part of our community.
