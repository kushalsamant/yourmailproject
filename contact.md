I offer an amalgamation of skills. If you want me to collaborate on some of your other projects or want to get me involved in what youâ€™re doing or something else or if you're trying to reach out to say hello or say something nice or have a question or complaint or suggestion about something or want to share something you made with me or anything like that you should @ me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvshvlin" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. I try to respond to as many posts as possible.

I know that's not as satisfying as sending a direct email but my inbox is a big fat mess and when I made it public there were too many messages to respond so they just went unread - that sucks for everyone.

If you are nearby and want to connect personally or have a business or startup idea you want to talk to me about or want a couple minutes of my time on the phone or in person or anything that involves a commitment of time, any amount of time, I very very gently have to say no.

Saying no is hard. There are so many extraordinary circumstances that should warrant me saying yes, but I can't. It's a hard, inflexible no.

Family comes first, work second and whatever is left over I like to use for me which is usually go for a run or travelling. There is no time left for yes. Even if that means missing opportunities.

really nails why saying yes for a quick coffee can be so destructive to the creative process - give <a href="http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank">this</a> a read to understand the maker's schedule.

I am sorry for no, but it's not without reason.
