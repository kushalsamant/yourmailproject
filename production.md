**Our production process**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business models.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

Since you have to use your own materials, the cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of your labour, your profit margins, PLUS any particulars you deem necessary, are values that are unknown to us.

If you have a preferred selling price, we request you to inform us about it via email  
[_yourmailproject (at) gmail (dot) com_](mailto:yourmailproject@gmail.com), **else we will split the profits**.
