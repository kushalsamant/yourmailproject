**Since 2020**.

This website is built using <a href="https://www.github.com/kvshvlin" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to do a bit to preserve a web that does not compromise on your time, privacy, and bandwidth. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

Your Mail Project is a practice that helps you calm your mind, since art moves almost every one of us in some form, either as connoisseurs, or creators, or curators.

We grow as a community by selling handmade illustrated postcards. We share profits with illustrators.

These handmade illustrated postcards are unique in the way that:
- no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade;
- every buyer gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them;
- these handmade illustrated postcards can be sent to your family and friends with / without writing a message, similar to regular postcards of India Post.

We ship blank postcards to anyone who signs up to create handmade illustrations on these postcards. If you sign up as an illustrator, then this process becomes a method to calm your mind by channeling your energies to create actual art.
