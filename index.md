**Since 2020**.

This website is built using <a href="https://www.github.com/kvshvlin" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to do a bit to preserve a web that does not compromise on your time, privacy, and bandwidth. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

Apologies.

We chose to make this temporary page to inform you that we are reviewing, revising, rewriting Your Mail Project with an intention to simplify it for both our illustrators and our patrons.

Come back another day, we will be back.
