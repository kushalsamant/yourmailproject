**Since 2020**.

This website is built using <a href="https://www.github.com/kvshvlin" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to do a bit to preserve a web that does not compromise on your time, privacy, and bandwidth.

Your Mail Project keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

Step 1. If you fill <a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">this</a> form, we will use your postal address and phone number to send you 11 blank postcards to illustrate upon.

Step 2. After you receive these 11 postcards, illustrate 10 postcards any how you fancy and use 1 postcard to test your art materials.

Step 3. Share work in progress images to your Instagram stories and tag our Instagram account @yourmailproject, or make an Instagram post and use hashtag #yourmailproject.

Step 4. Mail your illustrated postcards to us as soon as possible via speed post along with your preferred selling price for each.

Step 5. Albeit the original author reserve all copyrights, after we receive complete illustrated postcards we use numbered envelopes with Your Mail Project brand assets to curate the project.

Step 6. As a result, every handmade illustrated postcard is unique i.e. no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade, so every customer gets an exclusive product that they can send to friends and family via India Post with / without a message.

Step 7. We offer unique pricing for handmade illustrated postcards at flea markets / offline sales, offer the illustrator's selling price on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and offer subscriptions via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yourmailproject?fan_landing=true" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.

Step 8. Every handmade illustrated postcard is available for sale without the guarantee that it will sell, so all payouts are only valid for sold goods, and only unsold goods can be returned to the original author on demand.

Step 9. We handle complaints, inventory, operations, packaging, return orders, shipping, suggestions, and more so that you can meditate away and lose yourself in spellbound creativity, feel, look, touch, and quality of the illustrations.

Step 10. Once a sale happens, we pay half of the selling price to the illustrator, so every illustrator gets an exclusive deal.
