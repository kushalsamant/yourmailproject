**Your Mail Project is a community with the intention of creating opportunities for artists**.

From the ink, the colours, to paints; we are the people who fall madly in love with an orchestra of colours in space. We find magic in every stroke, as our hearts beat faster as they evoke, a rising tide of emotions. That there is nothing more peaceful than drawing that picture, that doodle, that painting, that caricature, and more.

Creating art is a habit, a meditative process, a peace in testing times. It's the essence of calming our minds and channeling our energies into expressive forms, of brush on canvas, and pen on paper, or anything that you can think of, in your own sensa. Our process is a chance at losing yourself in creative thought, while creating actual art.

We ship blank postcards to artists and ask them to create handmade illustrations on these postcards. We intend to grow as a collective by selling these handmade illustrated postcards and sharing profits with the artists. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

These handmade illustrated postcards are unique in the way that: no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade; everyone gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them. You can send these handmade illustrated postcards to your family and friends with / without writing a message on them.

**Join us as an Illustrator**.

**Your sign up process**.

If you want to illustrate, you can sign up using **<a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">this</a>** form.

It asks you to enter your postal address.

Don't you forget to give your phone number too, the postman may feel the need to use it.

We use this information to ship to you a package of 11 blank postcards.

**Your illustration process**.

Once you receive this package, you can go all in on your creativity!

Start by testing your materials on the 1st postcard.

Illustrate the next 10 postcards anyhow you fancy: doodle, draw, paint, sketch, or whatever you think of as art.

**Your Instagram process**.

We want you to share your work in progress images to your Instagram stories, and tag our Instagram account @yourmailproject

We curate your Instagram stories in our highlights.

You can use the hashtag '#yourmailproject' on Instagram whenever relevant.

**Your dead-line**.

We have only one deadline for you.

We have this because otherwise everyone procrastinates, including us.

We expect you to complete illustrating the blank postcards as soon as possible.

**Our production process**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business models.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

Since you have to use your own materials, the cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of your labour, your profit margins, PLUS any particulars you deem necessary, are values that are unknown to us.

**This is important** — If you have a preferred selling price, we request you to inform us about it via email  
[_yourmailproject (at) gmail (dot) com_](mailto:yourmailproject@gmail.com), **else we will split the profits**.

**Our marketing process**.

We will collect your handmade illustrated postcards, and photograph it.

We will showcase it on Instagram, also tag you for exposure and publicity.

**Our sales process**.

We sell handmade illustrated postcards on social media, flea markets, and various other market places.

Since we negotiate the price of every handmade illustrated postcard with the customers, we try our best to fetch the largest possible selling price for every handmade illustrated postcard.

We also offer subscription tiers on Patreon to create an ecosystem for this community, monthly demand for handmade illustrated postcards, and monthly revenue for the artists.

You can check the current subscription prices <a href="https://www.patreon.com/kvshvl?fan_landing=true" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Our after sales process**.

We handle everyone's complaints, inventory, packaging, return orders, and shipping, so that you can meditate away and lose yourself in spellbound creativity.

**Our profit sharing models**.

If you DO inform us about your preferred selling price then,
1. we will pay you your preferred selling price first,
1. and keep the rest as our profit, if there's any money left.

If you DO NOT inform us about your preferred selling price then,
1. we will pay you half of the profit first,
1. debit our operational costs from the other half of the profit,
1. and keep the rest as our profit.

We use our share of profit to sustain a bunch of things like our basic cost, coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, this website, PLUS any particulars we deem necessary.
