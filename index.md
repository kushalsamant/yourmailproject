**About**.

We are an art collective. We ask artists to illustrate postcards. We sell these postcards as a product. We share profits with the artist. If you want to buy original illustrations, then please explore our <a href="https://www.gumroad.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Shop</a>.

You will receive an unique Postcard every month.

These artworks are hand drawn on India Post postcards with space on the back for address and a message.

You can send these to family and friends via India Post in the same way we post a normal postcard.

When we say unique, we mean that,

- We make only one of each postcards.
- We don't make copies of these postcards.
- None of the other patrons, will ever get, the postcards you will receive.
- You will get original hand drawn postcards.
- You can rest assured that the ones you hold are unique in this universe.
- Join now and get an unique Postcard every month.

**Join us as an artist**.

If you want to illustrate, then '<a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">Join&nbsp;us&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist</a>'. This link opens a form that will ask you to enter your postal address and phone number. We will use this information to send you a package of 10 blank postcards.

Once you receive this package, you can unleash the creator within you. We want you to art these postcards up. Oh! Yes, with anything you want. Do not hesitate to doodle, draw, paint, sketch, or whatever you think of, as art.

Remember, we handle, respect, think of, and treat your work so that 'All copyrights are reserved by the original author of the artwork'.

Once you finish your work, send it to us. We will collect your artwork. We will find a customer for it. We will handle everyone's complaints, return orders, and shipping, et cetera. So that you can focus on being a creator.

Please note that we do not guarantee that your artwork will sell. We will list your artwork on our store for as long as you wish. If you want us to return your artwork to you, we can return it to you only if it is not sold.

Once your artwork sells, we will share the profits with you. We smoothen out the process as we go. We imagine this process will stabilize our country's economy through mass&nbsp;-&nbsp;scaled&nbsp;art.

We hope you love to be a part of our community.
