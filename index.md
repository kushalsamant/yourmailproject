From the ink, the colours, to paints, we are the people who fall madly in love with an orchestra of colours in space. We find magic in every stroke, our hearts beat faster as they evoke a rising tide of emotions. That there is nothing more peaceful than drawing that picture, that doodle, that painting, that caricature, and more.

We are a habit, a meditative process, a peace in testing times. We are the essence of calming our minds and channeling our energies into expressive forms, of brush on the canvas, and pen on paper, and anything that you can think of, in your own world. We are a chance at losing ourselves in creative thought, while creating actual art.

We are here to bring art to the people, and people to your art. A practice with the intentions of creating an opportunity for folks who can create. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.  
Something like this:

We ship blank postcards to you. You have to illustrate these postcards, and return them to us. We list these illustrated postcards on our Gumroad Shop or ship them to our Patrons. We share profits with you.

We grow as a collective. So you can talk about us to your family and friends, introduce them to our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Instagram Account</a>, or get them to make a purchase on our <a href="https://www.gumroad.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Gumroad Shop</a>, or get them to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yourmailproject?fan_landing=true" target="_blank">Patreon Account</a>.

**The patronage**:

Our patrons receive an unique Postcard every month.

These artworks are hand drawn on India Post postcards with space on the back for address and a message.

These postcards can be sent to family and friends via India Post in the same way we post a normal postcard.

When we say unique, we mean that,

- These are all hand drawn illustrations.
- No illustrations are repeated.
- No postcard is printed or reprinted.
- No postcard is treated like a magazine issue.
- No patron gets the same illustrated postcard as anyone else.
- Every patron can rest assured that the postcard they hold is exclusive to them in this universe.

Subscribe now and get an unique Postcard every month.

**If you want to illustrate: '<a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">Join&nbsp;us&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist</a>'**.

This link opens a form that will ask you to enter your postal address and phone number. We will use this information to send you a package of 11 blank postcards.

**Your role as an artist**: 

Once you receive this package, you can go all out with your creativity! You can use 1 postcard for testing your materials on it. We want you to art 10 postcards up in your own unique way. Oh! Yes, with anything you want. Feel free to doodle, draw, paint, sketch, or whatever you think of, as art.

**Creating a symbiotic relationship**:

Remember, we handle, respect, think of, and treat your work so that ‘All copyrights are reserved by the original author of the artwork’.

We will tag, repost, and share your stories on our Instagram account. If you want to share your work in progress images with us then you can use the hashtag '#yourmailproject'.

**You create, we distribute**:

Once you finish your artwork, send it to us. When your part ends, ours begins! We will collect your artwork, document it, photograph it, showcase it on Instagram, tag you in it. We will ship your artwork to customers on our Shop, or to our Patrons. We will handle everyone’s complaints, return orders, and shipping. So that you can focus all your energies on creating.

**Disclaimer**:

Please note that we do not guarantee that your artwork will sell. We will list your artwork on our store for as long as you wish. If you want us to return your artwork to you, we can return it to you only if it is not sold.

Once your artwork sells, we will share the profits with you. We shall smoothen out the process as we go. We imagine this process will help create more opportunities for artists.

We hope you love to be a part of our community.

Do join us!
