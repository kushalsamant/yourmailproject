**Get Handmade Illustrated Postcards every month**.

From the ink, the colours, to paints; we are the people who fall madly in love with an orchestra of colours in space. We find magic in every stroke, as our hearts beat faster as they evoke, a rising tide of emotions. That there is nothing more peaceful than drawing that picture, that doodle, that painting, that caricature, and more.

Creating art is a habit, a meditative process, a peace in testing times. It's the essence of calming our minds and channeling our energies into expressive forms, of brush on canvas, and pen on paper, or anything that you can think of, in your own sensa. Our process is a chance at losing yourself in creative thought, while creating actual art.

We ship blank postcards to artists and ask them to create handmade illustrations on these postcards. We intend to grow as a collective by selling these handmade illustrated postcards and sharing profits with the artists. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

These handmade illustrated postcards are unique in the way that: no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade; everyone gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them. You can send these handmade illustrated postcards to your family and friends with / without writing a message on them.
