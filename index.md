**About**.

We are an art collective. We intend to get artists to illustrate postcards. Then sell these postcards as a product to various marketplaces. Then share profits with the artist.

**For artists**.

If you are looking to illustrate, then '<a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">Join as an artist</a>'. The form will ask you for your postal address and phone number. We will use this to send you a pack of 10 blank postcards.

Once you receive this package, unleash the creativity within. Oh! Yes, with anything you want. We want you to art these postcards up. Do not hesitate to doodle, draw, paint, sketch, or whatever you think of, as art.

Remember, we handle, respect, think of, and treat your work as 'It's your art work'.

Once you finish your work, send it to us. We will collect your art. We will find a customer for it. We will handle everyone's complaints, return orders, and shipping, et cetera. So that [ [you can focus on being a creative]() ].

The fourth step is to share profits with the artist. We smoothen out the process as we go. We imagine this process will stabilize our country's economy through mass-scaled art.

We hope you love to be a part of our community.
