**Since 2020**.

If you think this website is unlike others, don't fret. This website is intentionally built using <a href="https://github.com/kushalsamant/yourmailproject" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to do a bit to preserve a web that does not compromise on your time, privacy, and bandwidth.

Your Mail Project keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

Step 1. If you fill <a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">this</a> form, we will use your postal address and phone number to send you 11 blank postcards to illustrate upon. We will add your name to our community of illustrators [_here_](https://kushalsamant.github.io/yourmailproject/pages/community.html).

Step 2. After you receive these 11 postcards, illustrate 10 postcards anyhow you fancy and use 1 postcard to test your art materials.

Step 3. Share work in progress images to your Instagram stories and tag our Instagram account @yourmailproject, or make an Instagram post and use hashtag #yourmailproject.

Step 4. Mail your illustrated postcards to us as soon as possible via speed post along with your preferred selling price for each.

Step 5. Albeit the original author reserves all copyrights, after we receive an illustrator's submission we use Your Mail Project brand assets to curate the project thenceforth.

Step 6. Every customer gets an exclusive product that will never be replicated in analog format and can be sent to friends and family via India Post with / without an accompanying message.

Step 7. Once a sale happens, we pay the illustrator. Read about how we handle payments [_here_](https://kushalsamant.github.io/yourmailproject/pages/payments.html).

Step 8. We offer case-by-case basis pricing for handmade illustrated postcards at flea markets / offline sales, the illustrator's preferred selling price on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, $1 pricing for each postcard for subscriptions on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yourmailproject?fan_landing=true" target="_blank">Patreon</a>, and merchandise on <a href="https://www.society6.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Society6</a>.

Step 9. We handle complaints, inventory, operations, packaging, return orders, shipping, suggestions, and more.

Step 10. Every handmade illustrated postcard is available for sale without the guarantee that it will sell, so all payouts are only valid for sold goods, and only unsold goods can be returned to the original author on demand.
