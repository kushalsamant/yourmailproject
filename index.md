**A story to tell**.

Here you can see how we're doing. By sharing this information we aim to demystify the weird and wonderful process of working as mostly bootstrapped creators. We're working our hardest to build a space that’s mindful, respectful, and accountable to thousands of lovely patrons. We've lots of ideas about how to do a better job, as well as lots of challenges. This is meant to be as transparent as reasonably possible.

The mission is to create. Since we're accountable to our patrons instead of advertisers, our incentive is always to create a meaningful product. This also means that the future of Your Mail Project relies entirely on sales.

We are a practice with the intentions of creating an opportunity for folks who can create. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent like this: We ship blank postcards to these **<a href="https://kvshvl.in/yourmailproject/artists.html">artists</a>** who create handmade illustrations on them before returning them to us. We grow as a collective by sharing profits with the artists. If you want to illustrate, you can join us **<a href="https://kvshvl.in/yourmailproject/join.html">here</a>**.

Here’s how you can help.

If you’re already following us on  **<a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Instagram</a>**, and want to chip in a little extra, or if you simply want to help us make faster progress, you can shop these illustrated postcards **<a class="btn" href="https://www.gumroad.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">here</a>**.

These postcards are unique in the way that: no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade; everyone gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them. You can send these to your family and friends with / without writing a message on them.
