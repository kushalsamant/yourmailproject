You will receive a package of postcards. We expect you to art it up.

Oh! Yes, with anything you want. It's your art work.

We curate art from various artists, find customers, handle everyone's complaints, handle return orders, ship finished pieces, share profits equally with the artist, and smoothen this process as we go.

This is our imaginary attempt to stabilize the country's economy through art.
