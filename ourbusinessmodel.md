**Our business model**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

Since illustrators have to use their own materials, the cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of labour, profit margins, PLUS any particulars deemed necessary, are values that are unknown to us.

We request all illustrators to inform us about their preferred selling price by attaching a note in their consignment of illustrated postcards.

Once a sale happens, we pay half of the selling price to the illustrator, so every illustrator gets an exclusive deal.
