**Handmade Illustrated Postcards**.

We ship blank postcards to artists and ask them to create handmade illustrations on these postcards. We grow as a collective by selling these handmade illustrated postcards and sharing profits with the artists.

These handmade illustrated postcards are unique in the way that: no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade; everyone gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them. You can send these handmade illustrated postcards to your family and friends with / without writing a message on them.
