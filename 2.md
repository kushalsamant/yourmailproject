**Handmade Illustrated Postcards**.

We ship blank postcards to artists and ask them to create handmade illustrations on these postcards. We grow as a collective by selling these handmade illustrated postcards and sharing profits with the artists.

These handmade illustrated postcards are unique in the way that: no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade; everyone gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them. You can send these handmade illustrated postcards to your family and friends with / without writing a message on them.

If you’re already following our content, and want to chip in a little extra, or if you simply want to help us make faster progress, you can DM us on **<a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" target="_blank">Instagram</a>** to order these handmade illustrated postcards.

If there’s something you don’t see here that you’d like to know, then email
