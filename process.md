**Process**.

We ship blank postcards to these **<a href="https://kvshvl.in/yourmailproject/artists.html">artists</a>** who create handmade illustrations on postcards. We grow as a collective by selling these handmade illustrated postcards and sharing profits with the artists. If you want to illustrate, you can join us **<a href="https://kvshvl.in/yourmailproject/join.html">here</a>**.

These handmade illustrated postcards are unique in the way that: no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade; everyone gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them. You can send these handmade illustrated postcards to your family and friends with / without writing a message on them.
