**Our payout models**.

If you DO inform us about your preferred selling price then,
1. we will pay you your preferred selling price first,
1. and keep the rest as our profit, if there's any money left.

If you DO NOT inform us about your preferred selling price then,
1. we will pay you half of the profit first,
1. debit our operational costs from the other half of the profit,
1. and keep the rest as our profit.

We use our share of profit to sustain a bunch of things like our basic cost, coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, this website, PLUS any particulars we deem necessary.
