**Our sales process**.

We sell handmade illustrated postcards on social media, flea markets, and various other market places.

Since every handmade illustrated postcard is unique, we do not have a fixed selling price.

We negotiate the price of every handmade illustrated postcard with the customers.

Our pricing varies.

We try our best to fetch the largest possible selling price for every handmade illustrated postcard.
