**About**.

Your Mail Project keeps things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

**Step 1**. If you fill <a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> form, we will use your postal address and phone number to send you 11 blank postcards to illustrate upon. Please bear in mind that your name will be mentioned publicly on the bottom of this page.

**Step 2**. After you receive these 11 postcards, illustrate 10 postcards anyhow you fancy and use 1 postcard to test your art materials.

**Step 3**. Share work-in-progress images to your Instagram stories and tag our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account @yourmailproject, or make an Instagram post and use hashtag #yourmailproject.

**Step 4**. Mail your illustrated postcards to us as soon as possible via speed post along with your preferred selling price for each.

**Step 5**. Albeit the original author reserves all copyrights, after we receive an illustrator's submission we use Your Mail Project brand assets to curate the project thenceforth.

**Step 6**. Every customer gets an exclusive product that will never be replicated in analog format and can be sent to friends and family via India Post with/without an accompanying message.

**Step 7**. Once a sale happens, we pay the illustrator. Read about how we handle payments [_here_](https://kushalsamant.github.io/yourmailproject/payments.html).

**Step 8**. Every handmade illustrated postcard is available for sale without the guarantee that it will sell, so all payouts to illustrators are only valid for sold goods, and only unsold goods can be returned to the original author on demand.

**Step 9**. You can buy handmade illustrated postcards on <a href="https://gumroad.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gumroad</a>.

**Step 10**. You can start a $1 per month subscription for handmade illustrated postcards on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yourmailproject?fan_landing=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.

**Step 11**. You can buy Your Mail Project merchandise on <a href="https://www.society6.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Society6</a>.

**Step 12**. We handle complaints, inventory, operations, packaging, return orders, shipping, suggestions, and more.
