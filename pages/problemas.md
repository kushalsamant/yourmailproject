Let's talk about arguments. The whole concept of peace revolves around the presence mutual respect. I fear contempt more than the lack of mutual respect. I fight a lot everyday. Fight. Yes, fight. Not debate. Not argue. Not discuss. But yes, communicate. Having done so, I have found that most of us segue to other topics.

Now I don’t know what you were doing when you picked this up. But you should stop and ponder. There are many reasons why it is essential to cut down the things that we do. Time is a thing. It is an asset only if you do something with it. Much like money. Much like any other asset.

**Automate**.

Automating your marketing by making Instagram Central.

1. Make an account for your project/products/office/firm on YouTube, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Medium, Instagram, and Facebook Pages.
2. Be mindful of having the same username on all platforms.
3. Login to [*IFTTT*](https://ifttt.com).com using your Google account.
4. Connect all accounts in [*IFTTT*](https://ifttt.com)'s services menu.
5. Make applets on [*IFTTT*](https://ifttt.com).
- If you make a new image post on Instagram then make a tweet with original image on Twitter.
- If you make a new image post on Instagram then make an image post on Tumblr.
- If you make a new image post on Instagram then pin post on pin board in Pinterest.
- If you make a new image post on Instagram then share post to Facebook Pages.
6. Repeat steps under section 5. for YouTube, and Medium.

Set this up first so that you don’t interrupt your creative flow later.

**How to apply for a COVID19 travel pass**?

Date: 12th May 2020

If you are stranded away from home, then these are the steps to apply for a travel pass.

1. Find a doctor for check up.
2. Then get a prescription for a covid19 test.
3. Then apply for a test at any local diagnostics centers such as Suburban Diagnostics, Metropolis, SRL, etc.
- This is a tricky process because they are not allowed to administer the test if you have no symptoms.
- They rejected my doctor's prescription which mentioned no symptoms.
- They asked me to wait at the counter, and get a fake prescription from the same doctor with minimum of two symptoms.
- The test is chargeable by law at INR 3500 if you visit a test center for sample collection, and INR 4500 if the technicians visit your home for sample collection.
- Nonetheless, the diagnostic center will charge you INR 4500 even if you visit a test centre for sample collection. i.e. they will bill you for a home visit for a sample collection that they take at the test center.
4. Then take the test.
5. Then wait for 48 hours for test report.
6. Then use that report to get a fitness certificate from the same doctor.
7. Then use that fitness certificate to apply for the travel pass on the website of the state you are stranded in.
- For example if you are stranded in Maharashtra then it is covid19.mhpolice.in
- Please Google search the website for your respective state.

A. This is a tricky process because the police will ask for a vehicle number with corresponding RC book.

- This applies even if you select the public transport option on the application.
- So assuming that you don't own a bus, you will have to be hopeful that they accept your application without the RC book.
- **So you cannot go home if you don't own a vehicle**.

B. For Mumbai, the website will direct to a emergency pass for medical cases page.

- It says, if you are a stranded student, migrant, or tourist, please apply to the local police station directly.
- Upon my visit to the police station, the cops at the police station informed that they have received instructions to issue travel pass only for interstate transit.
- They have received no instructions to issue travel pass for interdistrict transit.
- The local police advised to go home in an auto or a private vehicle.
- The autos are not allowed to cross intrastate borders.
- **So you cannot go home if you are stranded within Mumbai**.

**Letter to The Commissioner of Police, Mumbai**.

Date: 15th May 2020

Dear Mr. Param Bir Singh,  
Commissioner of Police,  
Mumbai,  
MH. India.

I am Kushal Dhananjay Samant.

I am a resident at the following address as per my passport records: 6/A2, Shree Hari CHS, Plot-11, Behind Neurogen Hospital, Sector 40, Seawoods (W), Navi Mumbai — 400706. MH. INDIA.

I am a stranded individual at the following address at the moment: C/o Satchit Puranik, Flat №14, Tabeer Terrace CHS, Lane Opposite Orchid Global Learning Academy, Versova, Andheri (W), Mumbai — 400061. MH. INDIA.

My apologies because I was unaware of the changes in the online application process that were being carried out by Maharashtra Police when I was preparing the following documents for my Travel Pass application as a stranded individual as per the previous form that was available on the website — [covid19.mhpolice.in/](http://covid19.mhpolice.in/).

I have followed through meticulously on all tests, and documents required for my travel back home. I am sending these documents for your reference along with this letter.

1. A prescription from Dr. Vernon Miranda to get a COVID19 test done, solely for travel purposes.
2. COVID19 test report from Suburban Diagnostics. My test report says, “SARS-CoV-2: Not detected.” i.e. COVID19 negative.
3. Fitness Certificate from Dr. Vernon Miranda based on this Test Report.
DN Nagar Police Station has quoted, “They have not received any instructions regarding inter-district transit for stranded individuals”. I have been advised one police officer to take an auto (which is unavailable) or take a private vehicle (which no one is willing to volunteer).

This ball is now, apparently in your court. The Mumbai Police website — [https://mumbaipolice.co.in/ApplicationforEmergencyTravelMigrant.html](https://mumbaipolice.co.in/ApplicationforEmergencyTravelMigrant.html) now deems it necessary that I should submit an RC Book and a driving license as an individual if I have to return home. Do you think that this is preposterous?

Because I imagine it to be so.

I would like to request you to kindly grant me either of these permissions.
1. Permission to return home by public bus transport or,
2. A letter that permits any auto driver to return home after dropping me home.

I hope you shall support my return. You can reply to this message or contact me on +918779632310 for any queries.

Thanking you very much.

Yours truly,  
Ar. Kushal Dhananjay Samant.

**Railway Line Intervention**.

Date: 21st May 2020

Have you seen this city - the city of Bombay?

It is a straight line from South to North. A line connected by one railway line or to be more precise three railway lines. Every day millions flock to work and back home on the three straight lines.

There is a thing about habits. If you want to shape a completely new you then all you will have to do is to change one habit that you currently have. You will have to override that habit with a new one.

If you can hold on to this new habit for a period of merely 21 days, then without realizing you will stick to the new habit or variation of it. When I say variation I don't mean a slight change. What I mean is that if you start being okay about getting up late in the morning then you will also start being ok about getting late with everything in your life.

So now if you want to change this entire city. Do you know how would you do that? It is a very simple thing to do.
All you need to do if to take that railway line and make a small change in what people do in that area. For example, if you want people to be clean and health-conscious along with a lot of other things that are related to hygiene, then you should give their ticket vendor a thermometer. Now because of this one person in their life who is checking their temperature whenever they go to buy a ticket from the ticket vendor, they will be conscious about thoughts that come along with that temperature reading.

The thoughts of being more careful about not having a fever when they are going to buy a ticket. This simple requirement will need them to have thoughts of being more careful about their health. These are further spilled over with them having the thoughts of being more careful about their hygiene.
