**Our business model**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 05.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 05.0 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.0.

Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 05.0 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52.0 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 09.85.

Since illustrators have to use their own materials, the cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of labour, profit margins, PLUS any particulars deemed necessary, are values that are unknown to us.

We request all illustrators to inform us of their preferred selling price (PSP) by attaching a note in their consignment of illustrated postcards.

We hope the following example illustrates our offer where a postcard sells at a price, say Rs. X.

The illustrator will earn, 
Rs. X - 

If illustrator's preferred selling price for the postcard.
If X > preferred selling price, we pay the illustrator

We pay an illustrator on a first priority basis.


1. Preferred Option: We will pay an illlustrator the preferred selling price and keep the rest of the profit. 

Once a sale happens, every illustrator get paid via one of these two exclusive deals.

1. If we are informed about the preferred selling price:
A. We pay the illustrator the actual selling price. preferred selling price or the actual selling price. We do not make a profit in this method unless the actual selling price is more than the preferred selling price.  

2. If we are NOT informed about the preferred selling price, then we divide the actual selling price into 2 parts. One part is paid to the illustrator, pay one with the illustrators and  half of the selling price to the illustrator, so 

If a pack of 10 postcards sells for Rs. 1000, then we will pay the artists:
Rs. 1000.0 / 2  
= Rs. 500.0.  
Whereas we will pay ourselves
= (Rs. 1000.0 / 2) - Rs. 98.5  
= Rs. 401.5.
