**Our business model**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 05.50 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 05.00 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.50 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.00.  
**= Cost A (CA)**.

Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 05.00 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.50 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.50.  
**= Cost B (CB)**.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(CA + CB) / 10 postcards in the package  
= (Rs. 52.00 + Rs. 46.50) / 10  
= Rs. 98.50 / 10  
= Rs. 09.85.  
**= Cost Price (CP)**.

Illustrators have to use their own materials to create the illustrations. Various cost borne by the illustrator i.e., the cost of labour, cost of materials, profit margins, PLUS any particulars deemed necessary, are values that are unknown to us.
**= Cost B (CB)**.


We request all illustrators to inform us of their **preferred selling price (CZ)** by attaching a note in their consignment of illustrated postcards. Once a sale happens, we pay an illustrator on a first priority basis.

Here's how we pay an illustrator:
**Please note that the customer decides the value of X**.  
First, We sell a postcard in the market for Rs. X.

If X is lesser than CZ,  
then we pay the illustrator Rs. X.  
Please note that we make Rs. 00 profit here.

If X is greater than CZ,  
then we pay the illustrator Rs. CZ.  
Please note that we make Rs. (X - CZ) profit here.

If in any case the value of CZ is not informed to us,  
then we pay the illustrator Rs. (X / 2).  
Please note that we make Rs. ([X / 2] - CP) profit here.

Example, If a pack of 10 postcards sells for Rs. 1000, then we will pay the illustrator:  
Rs. 1000.0 / 2  
= Rs. 500.0.  
Whereas we will pay ourselves,  
= (Rs. 1000.0 / 2) - Rs. 98.5  
= Rs. 401.5.
