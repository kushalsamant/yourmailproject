**Here's how we handle payments**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 05.50 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 05.00 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.50 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.00.  
**= Cost A (CA)**.

Illustrators have to use their own materials to create the illustrations.

Shipping 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 05.00 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.50 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.50.  
**= Cost B (CB)**.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost,  
(CA + CB) / 10 postcards in the package  
= (Rs. 52.00 + Rs. 46.50) / 10  
= Rs. 98.50 / 10  
= Rs. 09.85.  
**= Cost Price (CP)**.

We cannot be sure of certain values (including but not limited to) the cost of labour, cost of materials, expected profit, PLUS any particulars deemed necessary. Hence we request all illustrators to calculate their preferred selling price for every postcard they illustrate. They can send a note alongwith their handmade illustrated postcards to inform us about their **Preferred Selling Price (PSP)**.

We sell a postcard in the market for Rs. X.
Please note that the value of X is determined circumstantial.  

Once a sale happens, we pay an illustrator on a first priority basis.

If X is lesser than PSP,  
then we pay the illustrator Rs. X.  
Please note that we make Rs. 00 profit here.

If X is greater than PSP,  
then we pay the illustrator Rs. PSP.  
Please note that we make Rs. (X - PSP) profit here.

If in any case the value of PSP is not informed to us,  
then we pay the illustrator Rs. (X / 2).  
Please note that we make Rs. ([X / 2] - CP) profit here.

Example, If a pack of 10 postcards sells for Rs. 1000, then we will pay the illustrator:  
Rs. 1000.0 / 2  
= Rs. 500.0.  
Whereas we will pay ourselves,  
= (Rs. 1000.0 / 2) - Rs. 98.5  
= Rs. 401.5.
