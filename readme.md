**Get a Handmade Illustrated Postcard every month**.

Here you can see how we're doing. By sharing this information we aim to demystify the weird and wonderful process of working as mostly bootstrapped creators. We're working our hardest to build a space that’s mindful, respectful, and accountable to thousands of lovely patrons. We've lots of ideas about how to do a better job, as well as lots of challenges. This is meant to be as transparent as reasonably possible.

The mission is to create handmade illustrated postcards. Since we're accountable to our patrons instead of advertisers, our incentive is always to create a meaningful product. This also means that the future of Your Mail Project relies entirely on sales.

We ship blank postcards to artists and ask them to create handmade illustrations on these postcards. We grow as a collective by selling these handmade illustrated postcards and sharing profits with the artists.

These handmade illustrated postcards are unique in the way that: no illustration will ever be printed, published like a magazine, reprinted, or remade; everyone gets a handmade illustrated postcard that is exclusive to them. You can send these handmade illustrated postcards to your family and friends with / without writing a message on them.

If you’re already following our content, and want to chip in a little extra, or if you simply want to help us make faster progress, or if you would like to make a purchase, or if there’s something you don’t see here that you’d like to know, then you can DM us on Instagram.

**A Story To Tell**.

From the ink, the colours, to paints, we are the people who fall madly in love with an orchestra of colours in space. We find magic in every stroke, our hearts beat faster as they evoke, a rising tide of emotions. That there is nothing more peaceful than drawing that picture, that doodle, that painting, that caricature, and more.
 
We are a habit, a meditative process, a peace in testing times. We are the essence of calming our minds and channeling our energies into expressive forms, of brush on canvas, and pen on paper, or anything that you can think of, in your own world. We are a chance at losing ourselves in creative thought, while creating actual art.

We are a practice with the intentions of creating an opportunity for folks who can create. We keep things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

**If You Want To Illustrate**.

You can sign up using **<a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" target="_blank">this</a>** form.

It asks you to enter your postal address.

Don't you forget to give your phone number too, the postman may feel the need to use it.

We use this information to ship to you a package of 11 blank postcards.

**Your Role As An Illustrator**.

Once you receive this package, you can go all in! Unleash your creativity.

Ideally by testing 1 postcard with your materials to see.

We would love to see you illustrate 10 postcards in a month.

And yes! In your own unique way, whatever you may think that means: Do with anything you want, feel free to doodle, draw, sketch, or paint, or whatever you think of, as art.

If you want us to repost, tag, and share your work in progress images with the collective then use this hashtag '#yourmailproject' on Instagram whenever relevant.

**Dead-line**.

We have one deadline only.

We have this because otherwise everyone procrastinates, including us.

You need to complete illustrating the blank postcards in a month from the day you receive it.

It would be better if you can complete your submission as soon as possible.

**Post-production**.

Once you finish creating your handmade illustrated postcards, send them to us. When your part ends, is when ours has begun!

We will collect your handmade illustrated postcards, and photograph it.

We will showcase it on Instagram, also tag you for exposure and publicity.

We handle everyone's complaints, inventory, packaging, return orders, and shipping.

So that you can meditate away and lose yourself in spellbound creativity.

**Here's The Fine-print In A More Readable Size**.

Please note that we do not guarantee that your handmade illustrated postcards will sell, but we do our best to give it exposure instead.

You control if it’s still available for sale, but we can only return your handmade illustrated postcards to you if it’s not sold.

**Let's Talk Numbers**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

**A**. The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 5.5 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.

**B**. Returning 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 5 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.5 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.5.

**C**. Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost us,  
(Rs. 52 + Rs. 46.5) / 10 postcards in the package  
= Rs. 98.5 / 10  
= Rs. 9.85.

**D**. We levy an extra $2 charge to the customers on every handmade illustrated postcard to help us sustain a bunch of things like our basic cost, coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, this website, PLUS any particulars we deem necessary.

**E**. Since you have to use your own materials, the cost of materials used for creating the illustrations, the cost of your labour, your profit margins, are values that are unknown to us. We request you to share these values with us, PLUS any particulars you deem necessary, via email  
[_yourmailproject (at) gmail (dot) com_](mailto:yourmailproject@gmail.com).

If in simpler terms,

~~~
The selling price = S.  
Our costs = D.  
Your profit = E.
~~~

Then in simpler equations,

~~~
S = D + E.  
D = S - E.  
E = S - D.
~~~

We hope you will love to be a part of our community.
