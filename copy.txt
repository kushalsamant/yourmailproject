**Your Mail Project**.

You will recieve a package of postcards. You can art it up. Oh! Yes. With anything you want. It's your art work. We will curate art from various artists, find customers, handle everyone's complaints, handle return orders, ship finished pieces, share profits equally with the artist. This is an attempt to stabilize the country's economy through art.

Order art via mail now, or contact us using the links below to participate. Together we can save this country's economy.
