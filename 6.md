**Your role as an Illustrator**.

Once you receive this package, you can go all in! Unleash your creativity.
- Ideally by testing 1 postcard with your materials to see.
- We would love to see you illustrate 10 postcards in a month.
- And yes! In your own unique way, whatever you may think that means: Do with anything you want, feel free to doodle, draw, sketch, or paint, or whatever you think of, as art.
- If you want us to repost, tag, and share your work in progress images with the collective then use this hashtag '#yourmailproject' on Instagram whenever relevant.
