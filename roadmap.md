Here you can see how we're doing. By sharing this information we aim to demystify the weird and wonderful process of working as mostly bootstrapped creators. We're working our hardest to build a space that’s mindful, respectful, and accountable to thousands of lovely patrons. We've lots of ideas about how to do a better job, as well as lots of challenges. This is meant to be as transparent as reasonably possible.

The mission is to create. Since we're accountable to our patrons instead of advertisers, our incentive is always to create a meaningful product. This also means that the future of Your Mail Project relies entirely on community contributions.

Here’s how you can help.

Patreon charges various fees to these contributions as follows.

Payment fees: They cover the cost of processing payments from our patrons, including currency conversion, recurring billing, recovering failed payments, and fighting fraud.

Platform fees: They cover the cost of Patreon’s membership platform and are a percentage of our successful patron payments.

> Payment Amount — Rate per successful payment.  
> $3 or less — 5% + $0.10  
> Over $3 — 2.9% + $0.30  
> Additional 1% for non-US PayPal payments

The remainder enables Your Mail Project to sustain a bunch of things like coffee, logistics, operations, packaging, pizza, shipping to customers, support to artists, tech support, this website, &c.
