**The Roadmap**.

Here you can see how I'm doing. By sharing this information I aim to demystify the weird and wonderful process of working as a mostly bootstrapped creator. I'm working my hardest to build a space that’s mindful, respectful, and accountable to thousands of lovely patrons. I've lots of ideas about how to do a better job, as well as lots of challenges. This is meant to be as transparent as reasonably possible. If there’s something you don’t see here that you’d like to know, then email  
[_kushaldsamant (at) gmail (dot) com_](mailto:kushaldsamant@gmail.com).

The mission is to create. Since I'm accountable to my patrons instead of advertisers, my incentive is always to create meaningful collaboration. This also means that the future of my work relies entirely on community contributions. Here’s how you can help. If you’re already following my content and want to chip in a little extra, or if you simply want to help me make faster progress, you can make a monthly contribution.
